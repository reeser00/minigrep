# minigrep
## A mini version of the popular command-line utility "grep" written in rust.
### Description
minigrep is a command-line utility for searching plain-text data sets for lines that match regular expression. Its name comes from "g/re/p" wich was originally developed for the Unix operating system.
I decided to use this project as a way to get more familiar with the programming language rust.

### How to minigrep
To build the project, rustc / cargo are required.
